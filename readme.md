# blockplot

voxel hosting service. work in progress

## run it

you have to run two things: the backend (in `hoodie-server`) and the dev app

hoodie requires couchdb and some other stuff, you'll need to follow their [installation instructions](http://hood.ie/#installation)

then:

```sh
cd hoodie-server
npm install
npm start
```

then to run the dev server, go back into this folder and do:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
