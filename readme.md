# blockplot

voxel hosting service. work in progress

## run it

blockplot has two parts: the backend auth-server and the 100% client-side web app

### running the web app locally in dev mode

first run the server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

then in another terminal run the front-end dev server from the top level folder:

```
npm install
npm start
```

every time you refresh you'll get a fresh version of all the source code, so you can edit away!
